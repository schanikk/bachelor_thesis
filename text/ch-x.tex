%% Something about the results of this thesis
This is a paragraph about the results of this thesis. This Paragraph will be written after the finalizing the bachelor thesis.\\
This thesis addresses key aspects on understanding political discourse on social media platforms during election periods, especially the german election.
Since social media content has an increasing amount of multi modal data, such as images and videos, integrating these multi modal data into the topic modeling approach presented in this thesis.

Future work can extend this approach by integrating multimodal data. 

\citet{sowa-2000-knowledgerepr} proposed something very important.

In \citep{turing-1948-intelligentmachinery} we/I introduced another important thing.

We/I did other stuff too \citep{turing-1950-computingmachinery}.


Entpropy is a measure for chaos \cite{shannon-1948-entropy}.

Transfer Learning is an important concept \cite{ruder-2019-phdthesis,ruder-2019-transferlearning} which uses deep learning \citep{goodfellow-2016-dlbook}.
